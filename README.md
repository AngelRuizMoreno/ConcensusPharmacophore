# ConcensusPharmacophore


A consensus pharmacophore is a set of characteristics shared by a group of active molecules that bind to the same target. It can be used to represent the essential properties of a molecular interaction and to guide the development of new compounds with comparable or improved activity. Either ligand-based or structure-based methods can be used to generate a consensus pharmacophore. Ligand-based methods examine the chemical structures of known active compounds to determine the common features that account for their activity. Structure-based methods analyze the interaction site and extract the key features required for binding by using the three-dimensional structure of the target protein and its bound ligands.


A consensus pharmacophore is a collection of geometric elements, such as points, spheres, vectors, or planes, that represent various types of features, such as hydrophobic regions, hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, aromatic rings, or positive or negative charges. A consensus pharmacophore can also be used to find new potential ligands that match the features and are likely to bind to the target. This is known as reversed pharmacophore matching, and it is a useful technique for identifying drug targets and performing virtual screening.

This library was developed to generate concensus pharmacophores from large datasets of ligand-protein complexes.
